        <strong>When you check out an audio recorder, you will receive a black case containing the following: </strong>
        <ul>
            <li>A ZOOM H3-VR Recorder</li>
            <li>A tripod stand with two screw-on adapters and a rubber covering to protect the threads. The
                brass adapter screws into the bottom of the H3-VR.
            </li>
            <li>
                An extender which attaches to the brass adapter and the H3-VR, to allow the recording device to
                extend outward from the center of the tripod. (Note: If you decide to use this extender, make sure
                the cartilever is directly above one of the tripod legs, so as to avoid the possibility of the
                tripod tripping over.)
            </li>
            <li>
                Two windscreens; one that is black and if a stiff material, one that is grey and fluffy. Any
                outdoor recordings must use both windscreens, the fluffy one over the stiff one.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <strong>You will need your own: </strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Headphones (for biaural monitoring)</li>
            <li>Pair of AA batteries (the included set will eventually run out)</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Recording Instructions</strong>
        <p>When choosing recording locations, try to choose one that currently has few recordings. A link to a map of all current
            recordings can be found <a href="http://34.216.123.183:5000/joy/map" target="_blank">here</a>, and a spreadsheet can be found above. </p>
        <p>Each submission should be between two and ten minutes long. Make as many submissions as you like,
            the more the merrier! At the beginning of each submission, speak the following information into the
            the microphone:  </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your name</li>
            <li>The date/time</li>
            <li>your location, in common parlance (e.g. "The Cow Pasture", "Upper Campus", "a trail
                in Pogonip", "the Porter dining hall")
            </li>
            <li>Your location, in longitude and latitude, in decimal degrees. <a href="https://support.google.com/maps/answer/18539?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en" target="_blank">(Here are
                instructions to finding longitude/latitude using google maps.)</a> Four significant figures after
                the decimal point should suffice. (e.g. "36.9938, 122.0601")
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>optional: </strong> a photograph or panoramic image of your location can be captured and sent to 
                    JBMyers@ucsc.edu.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <strong>File Format</strong>
        <p>Please do not mess with the settings; it is important to the project that all files have the same bit
            depth, sample rate, ambisonic format, mic positioning, etc.
        </p>
        <p>In case settings do inexplicably get changed, here are the standard settings we are using.</p>

        <strong>Record Format</strong>
        <p>24 bit; 48 kHz sample rate.</p>
        <p>Ambisonic B: AmbiX</p>

        <strong>Monitoring</strong>
        <p>Binaural</p>

        <strong>Limiter</strong>
        <p>On</p>
        <p>Threshold: -2dBFS</p>
        <p>Attack Time: 1 ms</p>
        <p>Release Time: 200 ms</p>

        <strong>Mic Position</strong>
        <p>Upright</p>

        <strong>Mic Gain</strong>
        <p>Variable, dependent on sound recording situation.</p>
